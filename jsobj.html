    <h3>JavaScipt Objects Definition:</h3>
    <p>Object instances and Object prototype object. All objects in JavaScript are descended from Object ; 
    all objects inherit methods and properties from Object.prototype , although they may be
    overridden. For example, other constructors' prototypes override the 
    constructor property and provide their own toString() methods.</p>
